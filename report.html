        <main>
            <ol class="main-list">
                <li>The client I chose for Project 1 is the JMU Women In Technology organization. Women In Technology is a student group at JMU for women in STEM which promotes and encourages young women to pursue technological careers and provides a sense of community for women at JMU pursuing similar majors.</li>
                <li>The content on my site is entirely original with the exception of many of the logos on my site which are third-party images adhering to all licenses.</li>
                <li>My site includes five pages: Home, About Us, Upcoming Events, Meet the Team, and Contact.</li>
                <li>The header of my site has the organization's name and is consistent across all pages.</li>
                <li>There are navigation links on each page of my site that allow the user to easily access any of the other four pages. The navigation is consistent across all four pages, with the home page being the exception. The home page navigation differs from the other pages in that it is part of the main page content, card style, and are aligned horizontally rather than stacked vertically. The navigation background color and fonts are consisten across pages. Lastly, the navigation shifts from being fixed on the left-hand side of the page to being a drop-down menu when the dispay width is too small.</li>
                <li>My site supports distinct layouts for various screen sizes on all of its pages. On a desktop site, the user can resize the page from full screen down to the smallest their browser will allow without any disruptions. The styling of content sometimes shifts 2-3 times during re-sizing to allow for a more natural and gradual change. Some examples of my responsive web design are as follows
                    <ul class="sub-list">
                        <li>As mentioned in (5), the navigation links on the sidebar disapear on a mobile device or on a screen with small width. The navigation bar becomes a drop down menu located in the top right corner. This allows the main content to use the full screen width.</li>
                        <li>The header font size shrinks with the page width to ensure each line remains a single line rather than wrapping across multiple lines.</li>
                        <li>On the about us page, there are three boxes titled "Professional", "Social", and "Volunteer", which when clicked on each display a text box with more details. While the page width is a between a full desktop screen and about half of a desktop screen, the boxes are vertically stacked and the textbox appears next to the boxes. If the screen width is smaller, the boxes transition to being side-by-side, with the textbox appearing below them. If a user further shrinks their screen, they will notice the boxes shrinking as well, ensuring that they do not wrap onto the next line or create horizontal scrolling.</li>
                        <li>Similarly to the re-sizing of boxes on the about us page, the navigation cards on the home page re-size with the with the width of the page. The cards remain side-by-side but shrink in size while the width is still large enough, then when this is no longer feasible, stack one on top of the other.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>I created a distinct style that is shared across all pages on my site. The shades of purple used on the site are consistent across all pages. Heading fonts vs. paragraph fonts are also kept consistent. The header, navigation, footer, and main sections are also in the same location on all pages. Repeated styling rules are placed in the following shared style sheets: headerfooter.css, navigation.css, body.css.</li>
                <li>My site includes a variety of images including logos and photographs. Every image tag contains an alt attribute which describes the image contents.</li>
                <li>Every page on my site has the WIT logo as its favicon.</li>
                <li>All non-HTML files and resources are organized appropriately into three directories: images, js, fonts, and css. The image directory is further organized into sub-directories.</li>
                <li>I did not use any libraries or frameworks to create my site.</li>
                <li>TODO: each page and stylesheet of your site must validate without warning on W3C's Nu Validator</li>
                <li>The content on my pages is neatly organized with a favoring for left-alignment. Textual content, including paragraphs and headings are always aligned on the left-side. Some images and other more "visual" elements are centered.</li>
                <li>The header and headings on my site use Google's Monoserrat font, a sans-serif font, where as paragraphs use a serif font.</li>
                <li>TODO: The contact page of my site contains a form collecting names and email addresses of potential members. The form invokes JavaScript which ...</li>
                <li>The upcoming events page of my site contains several external links. These links open up a new tab, which promotes users to stay on my site rather than completing leaving.</li>
                <li>My sourcecode uses conventional styling for each language and is consistent across all files of the same type. HTML element classes and IDs directly relate to the content they contain and thus are meaningful.</li>
                <li>On the home page, the height, width, and font-size of the navigation cards are responsive to the width of the screen and therefore change with the re-sizing of a browser window. I added a transition to all three properties to make the changes more smooth and seamless.</li>
                <li>My site is stored in a private repository on GitHub and shared with twodee.</li>
                <li>All file names are lowercase and contain only alphanumerica characters.</li>
                <li>The domain name of my site is nstock.me</li>
                <li>My site served out over HTTPS on port 443.</li>
                <li>Users who access my site over HTTP on port 80 are automatically re-directed to port 443.</li>
                <li>My Git repository shows a steady flow of commits starting on September 21st.</li>
                <li>This list satisfies the Report requirement of an itemized breakdown detailing how I met the expectations provided.</li>
