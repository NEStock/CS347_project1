                    <p>We are a group of individuals who are passionate about promoting women in STEM, with an emphasis on technological careers. We invite students of all majors and minors and both men and women to join us in networking with technological firms and creating a community of like minded individuals!</p>

                    <p>While we have been an organization at JMU for longer, we officially became an ACM-W Student Chapter in October 2018.</p>

            <h3 class="sub-headings">What do we do?</h3>
            <p>Our organization is centered on three main types of events: Professional, Social, and Volunteer. Throughout the year, we host a variety of events and meetings ranging from resume workshops to game nights! Our biggest event of the year is DIGITAL, an annual event hosted at JMU which gives middle and high school girls in the Harrisonburg community the opportunity to learn about technology and consider a career path in technology. To learn more about DIGITAL, visit <a href="https://www.jmu.edu/pce/programs/all/women-in-technology/index.shtml" target="_blank"  class="external-link">JMU: DIGITAL</a></p>

                </div>
                <p class="events-information" id="professional-info">Professional events are typically either <span>professional development workshops</span> or <span>company presentations</span>. We typically host a resume workshop led by a JMU University Career Center Liason and an enrollment workshop where upperclassmen share their knowledge and advice and underclassmen have the opportunity to get help on the process of scheduling and their own next semester schedules. Additionally, we invite several company representatives to present to our organization about opportunities they have available for internships and jobs, what it is like to work there, and any advice they might have for female STEM majors.</p>
                <p class="events-information" id="social-info">Social events are hosted throughout the year to give our members the opportunity to meet friends and build connections with other women in similar majors. Building a community of women in STEM at JMU gives our members a support system and a network of classmates. In the past, we have also collaborated with other JMU orgnizations for women in STEM such as Assoiciation for Women Geoscientists and Engineering Ambassadors. Some social events we have hosted include  <span>movie nights, paint nights, pumpkin carving, game nights, roller skating, hiking, and Friendsgiving!</span></p>
                <p class="events-information" id="volunteer-info">Volunteer events include <span>DIGITAL</span>, teaming with <a href="https://www.ontheroadcollaborative.com/">On The Road Collaborative</a> to develop and teach a computer science <span>after school program</span> for middle schoolers, and <span>writing postcards</span> to incoming female JMU Computer Science majors. As women in mainly male dominated females, it is important for us to give back to our communities, including both JMU and Harrisonburg, in ways that encourage young women to consider STEM and empower them to believe in themselves. We can act as role models for those a step behind us, just as we all have role models who have helped us get to where we are.</p>
