                    <h3 class="event-date">Saturday, October 17th, 2020</h3>
                    <p>Every year, Women in Technology hosts DIGITAL, an outreach program in which middle and high school girls from the Shenandoah community come to JMU to receive exposure to technology and to learn about being a woman in technology. Usually we have many sessions with session leaders and volunteers assisting sessions, preparing resources, etc.</p>
                    <p>Of course, this year, DIGITAL has to be more... digital. After a period of deliberation, Dr. Weikle and our conference chair, Hannah Ripley, have concluded that the best way to accomplish this is by limiting participant numbers and hosting sessions virtually (possibly in Zoom breakout rooms). We plan to offer two session options: teaching girls how to program a microbit (for younger students) and teaching girls how to program a microbit connected to a robot (for older students).</p>
                    <p>Our current prospective date for DIGITAL is Saturday, October 17th, but we may consider pushing this date back to a Saturday in November if necessary.</p>
                    <p>We'd like to do at least 8 groups, and each one needs at least one volunteer with a foundation in coding and/or leadership. In accordance with DIGITAL's volunteer policy and to assure everyone is as comfortable and safe as possible, we need at least two volunteers for each group. As such, we need at least 16 volunteers!</p>
                    <p>If you'd like to volunteer, please fill out this <a href="https://forms.gle/5V5N5in9a1CdpT7L6" target="_blank" class="external-link">form</a>.</p>
